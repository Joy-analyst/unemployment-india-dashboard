This project is an **interactive dashboard** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) that explores and visualises unemployment trends in India. The dashboard allows users to filter by date range, analyse unemployment rates over time, compare across areas, and even run a simple regression‑based forecast for short‑term prediction.
